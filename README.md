# Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression

### Objectives
This project aims to analyze insurance claims data and build a predictive model to estimate the number of claims based on various features. The primary objectives include:
- Exploring and visualizing the distribution of key numerical features in the dataset.
- Handling categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.
- Preprocessing the data using scaling and encoding techniques.
- Developing and evaluating a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a Poisson distribution to predict the number of claims.

### Key Concepts
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the distributions of key variables such as `age_of_driver`, `car_age`, and `number_of_claims`.
- **Generalized Linear Model (GLM)**: Applying a Poisson regression model to predict count-based outcomes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming features using `ColumnTransformer` to prepare the data for modeling.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For data preprocessing, encoding, and splitting the dataset.
- **Statsmodels**: For building and analyzing the Generalized Linear Model (GLM).
- **Python**: The programming language used for this project.
